This project uses the language python.

The poker simulation program integrates a Monte Carlo simulation functionality to estimate winning probabilities based on player hands and community cards. 

The Player class tracks individual player statistics and actions, while the PokerGame class orchestrates the game flow, including player interactions and 

betting rounds. When players make decisions, the Monte Carlo simulation runs multiple iterations to determine the likelihood of winning given the current state

of the game. This probabilistic approach allows players to make informed decisions based on the expected value of their bets and hands. Players can utilize their 

hand strength, pot size, and opponent behaviors to optimize their strategies in real-time. After each round, the game resets the player bets while preserving their 

balances, enabling ongoing play and strategic exploration. Overall, the program creates a dynamic poker environment that combines traditional gameplay with advanced 
statistical analysis for a comprehensive simulation experience.
